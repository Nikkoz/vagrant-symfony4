# Vagrant environment for Symfony4

This project provides a virtual environment for Symfony4 development using
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com).

### Usage

Installation is as easy as cloning a GitHub project:

```
$ cd your-project
$ git clone https://github.com/Nikkoz/vagrant-symfony4.git .
```

Or, if you're using Git already in your project, you can use it as a submodule:

```
$ cd your-project
$ git submodule add https://github.com/Nikkoz/vagrant-symfony4.git .
```

After the project is added, you can start the environment like this:

```
$ vagrant up
```
